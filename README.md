# stock-portfolio

[stock-portfolio](http://frozen-reaches-18647.herokuapp.com/) is an app where a registered user can buy stocks and view their portfolio and transaction history that uses the [IEX Cloud API](https://iexcloud.io/docs/api/) to fetch current stock information. The user's portfolio displays the current stock price and the total current value of the user's stocks, and is styled to indicate if the current price is up or down from the purchase price.
